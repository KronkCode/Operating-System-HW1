# Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm

This repository contains Python code implementing a preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. SJF is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.

## Introduction

The code simulates the execution of processes in a preemptive SJF scheduling environment. It reads process information from an input file, runs the SJF algorithm on the processes, and prints out the scheduling details such as wait time, turnaround time, and response time for each process.

## Features

- Implements preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm.
- Reads input process information from a text file.
- Calculates and prints wait time, turnaround time, and response time for each process.
- Handles invalid input and file errors gracefully.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (I used Ubuntu)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/shortest-job-first-scheduling.git
